This is a timed Doctor Who quiz. There are three questions. The user has 60 seconds to answer. For each correct question the user receives 25 points and for every wrong answer they lose 5 seconds. 
The game ends when the timer runs out or all of the questions are answered. The user then has a chance to enter their initials. The user may look at the high scores, which are saved in local storage at any time.
